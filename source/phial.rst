About Phial
***********

Phial (pronounces "file") is a toolbox for use with 
`PyPhi <https://pyphi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Its intent is to make it easy to do lots of
`IIT <http://integratedinformationtheory.org/>`_ experiments. Our hope
is that this toolbox will allow people that are not deeply imbedded in
IIT research to run and share experiments.

Some features:

* Generate TPM from node functions.
* Generate all possible node functions.  
* Save and restore everything needed to reproduce an experiement.
* Plot results.
* Analyze network and state graphs.
* Looping for doing lots of related experiments (e.g. calculate Phi for
  all reachable states in a TPM)
